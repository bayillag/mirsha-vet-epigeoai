**Mirsha VetEpiGeoAI** is an integrated, workflow-centric national platform designed to support the entire lifecycle of animal health management in Ethiopiaâ€”from field-level outbreak investigation to strategic national surveillance, predictive modeling, and policy support.

This platform is architected into four primary divisions, each containing specialized modules to serve users from field veterinarians to national policymakers.

## Getting Started

This repository is fully configured for **GitHub Codespaces**, which provides a complete, cloud-based development environment.

1.  **Launch Codespace:** Click the "Open in GitHub Codespaces" badge above.
2.  **Wait for Setup:** The environment will automatically build and start the application and database containers, install all dependencies, and configure VS Code. This may take several minutes on the first run.
3.  **Initialize the Database:** Open a terminal in the Codespace (`Ctrl+\`` or `Cmd+\``) and run the setup script:
    ```bash
    # First, load the spatial data (shapefiles)
    docker exec -i mirsha_db shp2pgsql -s 4326 -I /workspaces/mirsha-vet-epigeoai/data/raw/gis/your_shapefile.shp public.admin_woredas | docker exec -i mirsha_db psql -d vet_epigeoai_db -U vet_user

    # Then, create the schema and load tabular data
    python src/scripts/setup_database.py
    ```
4.  **Run the Dashboard:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    A pop-up will allow you to open the running dashboard in your browser.
